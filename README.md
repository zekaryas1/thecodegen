# The Codegen
- Eliminate repetitive tasks by using a simple template based code generator.

## Todos


- [ ] decide how dialog components should work {should pass data or id and fetch again } 
- [ ] what datatype to use for columns and refactor type-array in entities and columnsdialog


## To run the project

```shell
yarn add #yarn install
npx prisma migrate dev --name init #optional if db and migrations are tracked
yarn run dev
```

## Commands to remember
```shell
npx prisma studio  #to access database ui interface by prisma
prisma generate  # to generate type definition
npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name #to initiate migration
prisma format   #to format and let prisma generate relation
```

## Next.js Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
